# Deck of Cards

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.3.

Contains page layout, child route, translation and some unit tests.

Very basic UI!!!

## Development concept

In this small demo I wanted to build a little piece of a few things we can do with angular
    - Unit Tests;
    - Translations;
    - Layout selection by route and children routes;
    - Dependency injection;
    - Shared Module;
    - Sparation by modules;
    - Usage of selector and route to load component;
    - Input decorator;
    - Very basic UI skill :-)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
