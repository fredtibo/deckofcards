# Deck of Cards

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.3.

## Development concept

In this small demo I wanted to build a little piece of a few things we can do with angular in a very short period of time:
- Unit Tests;
- Translations;
- Layout selection by route and children routes;
- Dependency injection;
- Shared Module;
- Separation by modules;
- Usage of selector and route to load component;
- Input decorator;
- Very basic UI skill :-)
- Some fundamentals ng directives and concepts.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
